Wire Framed the website:

![My Image](/assets/images/wire-frame.png)

Created a:
index.html
reset.html (copied from a class example)
style.css

Planned the index.html by creating semantic html elements and added comments about what I want to have in each section. 

Created the Nav bar with hover function when you hover over the items in the Nav bar. 

Added Flex function so the website can be viewed on various screen sizes.

Added Home root functionality and links to my my previous portfolio work. 

Added images with Alt attributes.

Added Contact Me functionality.

Added scrolling.

Played with font styles, and various colors in an attempt to make the website look less horrible.
