# week-2-homework

Building our personal portfolio.

Wire Framed the website:
[Insert URL:                ]

Created a:
index.html
reset.html (copied from a class example)
style.css

Planned the index.html by creating semantic html elements and added comments about what I want to have in each section. 

Created the beginning of the Nav bar with hover function when you hover over the items in the Nav bar.
